# Lesson: JS 0 - Foundations

## Overview

### Numbers Math

- Division: this subsection is effective since most people have been exposed to division.
- Mod:
  - Students from non-STEM related professions may not be familiar with the modulo operation.
  - Recommendation: briefly describe the operation as "finding the remainder after division"

## Variables

### Best Practice

Typo: has -> have

> Best practice means that you should **always** practice this habit because all good software engineers ~~has~~ have this habit.

#### const

Typo: that -> when

> `const` stands for constant. Use `const` to declare a variable ~~that~~ when you never plan to change its value, like the following example:

#### let

Typo: that -> and

> If you need to declare a variable ~~that~~ and you might need to change its value later, you should use let.

## Functions

This subsection should be a sibling, not a child of the Truthy/Falsey subsection in the table of contents

### Writing an Arrow Function

Indentation should be fixed for the `makeBasket` example.
