# Lesson: JS1 - HTML & Functions

## How to Follow Along

Consider changing quote to strong/bold:

> When you open the file (double click or right click â†’ open with browser), you should see a Welcome! heading and an input box. The large Welcome! text and the input box that the browser displays from the `h1` and `input` ~~`elements`~~ **elements**.

Grammar, add the article "An":

> HTML element is everything from the opening tag to the closing tag:

> An HTML element is everything from the opening tag to the closing tag:

It might be useful to reframe (or possibly summarize) the description of tags and elements from a top-down perspective:

- Elements are the parts that make up the HTML document
- Elements are composed of tags and enclosed content
- All elements begin with an opening tag
- Some elements are only composed of an opening tag
- Most elements have closing tags as well as content enclosed between the opening and closing tags

## HTML Example

> Create a new HTML file, call it `challenge1.html`, open it in your browser, and try to match each **tag** instruction with its corresponding **element**!

What does it mean to "match each **tag** instruction with its corresponding **element**"? There's nothing to do here but type the code into the file and view it in a browser. It might make more sense to describe the activity as something like, "add the following code to the file, save the file, and view it in your browser".

Consider adding "in":

> (Note that we're getting you started on a later exercise, **in** which you will write HTML instructions for Challenge 1 from the previous lesson.)
