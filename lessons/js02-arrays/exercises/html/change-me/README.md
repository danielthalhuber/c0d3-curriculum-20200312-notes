# Change Me

## Goal

Create an h1 element that says Change Me, an input box, and a submit button. When the submit button is clicked, the h1 element is changed to whatever is inside the input box.

## Process

1. Create an HTML document
2. Add the following elements to the `body`:
   - `h1` with the text: Change Me
   - `input:text`
   - `button` with the text: Submit
   - `script` (empty for now)
3. In the `script`:
   - Identify the `h1`, `input`, and `button`
   - Add a click event handler to `button` which sets the text of `h1` to the value of `input`
