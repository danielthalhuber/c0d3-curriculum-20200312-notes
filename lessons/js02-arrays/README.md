# JS2 - Arrays

## Preflight

This section has the reader create an npm package with the single dependency `jest`. The package contains two files:

- `prefilght.js`: contains solutions to exercises in the Preflight section
- `preflight.test.js`: contains tests for the solutions in `preflight.js`

I will modify this structure slightly so that the package has the following structure:

- `README.md`: provides descriptions and links to code and test files for each solution
- For each solution:
  - `solution-name.js`: file containing solution code for an exercise
  - `solution-name.test.js`: file containing test code for an exercise
