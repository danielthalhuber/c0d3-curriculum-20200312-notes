# C0D3 Curriculum Review

## Overview

This is a set of notes to accompany the C0D3 Curriculum. At the time of starting these notes (3/12/2020), the curriculum consists of 6 (or more?) lessons. Each lesson covers a different topic, with informal exercises to reinforce concepts, and formal coding challenges to test retention/mastery.

The primary learning resources are:

- [The book](https://c0d3.com/book), which
  - Establishes expectations for the learning process
  - Introduces prerequisite concepts
  - Describes how to set up a development environment
  - Introduces concepts and provides informal exercises for each lesson
- [The curriculum repo](https://github.com/garageScript/curriculum), which contain the coding challenges
- [The curriculum web app](https://c0d3.com/curriculum), which provides an interface for each lesson challenge where:
  - Students submit solutions
  - Mentors provide feedback and approve/reject student submissions

The process that students currently follow for each lesson:

- Read a lesson chapter from [the book](https://c0d3.com/book)
- Create solutions for each lesson challenge in the curriculum repo
- Submit solutions to the curriculum web app
- Start a new lesson when all lesson challenge solutions have been approved by a mentor in the web app
